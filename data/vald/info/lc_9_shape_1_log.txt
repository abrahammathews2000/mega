Log for creating lightcurves for: 
    data/vald/npy/shape/shape_1.npy   Vald <-- change this in code
    (1000  shapes - [ ]--> Confirm from lc simulated)
With following property
    lc_file_name: data/vald/npy/lc/lc_9_shape_1.npy <-- change this in code
    LDCs=[0.4,0.05] |  <-- change this in code
    star2mega_ratio_array = 4 |

1. Create light curve

2. Create light curve as npy file
