Log for creating lightcurves for: 
    data/vald/npy/shape/shape_1.npy   Vald <-- change this in code
    (1000  shapes - [ (1000,100)]--> Confirm from lc simulated)
With following property
    lc_file_name: data/vald/npy/lc/lc_10_shape_multisize_multiLDC.npy <-- change this in code

With following property:
LD_Coeff_dist_start = [0.1,0.05], LD_Coeff_dist_stop = [0.9,0.2],
star2mega_radius_ratio_start = 3, star2mega_radius_ratio_stop = 20
