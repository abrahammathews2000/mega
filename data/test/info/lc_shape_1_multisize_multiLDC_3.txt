Log for creating lightcurves for: 
    data/test/npy/shape/shape_1.npy [(250, 100)]
    ((250, 100)  shapes - [(250, 100)]--> Confirm from lc simulated)
With following property
    lc_file_name: data/test/npy/lc/lc_shape_1_multisize_multiLDC_3.npy <-- change this in code
    LD_Coeff_dist_start = [0, 0], LD_Coeff_dist_stop = [1, 0.55],
    star2mega_radius_ratio_start = 2, star2mega_radius_ratio_stop = 30
